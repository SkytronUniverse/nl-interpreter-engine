If the server replies with a redirect, the Client first uses the CheckRedirect function to determine whether the redirect should be followed. If permitted, a 301, 302, or 303 redirect causes subsequent requests to use HTTP method GET (or HEAD if the original request was HEAD), with no body. A 307 or 308 redirect preserves the original HTTP method and body, provided that the Request.GetBody function is defined. The NewRequest function automatically sets GetBody for common standard library body types.
